>
>Dear George,
>
>attached please find a draft version of the EOSS crypto token 
>documentation (instruction & reference) and the source code of  the 
>EOSS sample reader program. The sample program demonstrates how a 
>crypto token can be used the read out an EOSS seal.
>
>LANL may have the problem that they neither have an EOSS Tester ET1 nor 
>the corresponding tester software. Hence, they're currently not able to 
>initialize a seal and tranfer the keys to the crypto token. As a 
>workaround, they could re-enable the "Initialize seal" menu item in the 
>EOSS Reader by editing the source code of the corresponding HTML page.
>The name of the file is eossreaderactions.htm, located in the HTML 
>subdirectory of the EOSS Reader installation directory. At the bottom 
>of the HTML source file, there's a table definition for the main menu. 
>One row definition (tr) is commented out:
>
><!--
><tr class="menu">
><td><a href="EossReaderInitialization.htm">&gt;&gt; Initialize the 
>seal</a></td> </tr>
>-->
>
>Removing the comment tags <!-- and --> , will enable the initialization 
>option. However, the keys got to be stored somewhere. We no longer 
>support the Key-Manager. Thus, the only way to store the keys is to use 
>the database interface of the crypto token server. The database 
>interface bases on ODBC. Chapter 6 of the crypto token documentation 
>explains how the MS ACCESS database can be registered as an ODBC 
>datasource. An empty database file (eoss.mdb) is attached to this 
>message.
>
>After these modifications, LANL will be able to initialize a seal. The 
>keys are automatically stored in the database. To load the keys into a 
>crypto token, one has to insert the token to an USB port. Clicking the 
>yellow token icon in the taskbar notification area, opens a dialog box.
>The dialog provides an Add button that opens the key-set selection 
>dialog.
>
>Please note, that for an unattended system, it is not recommended to 
>set a password for a token! There will probably be no operator who 
>could enter the password at start-up.
